Create a quiz app using HTML, CSS and JS.

The flow goes as thus,
The user inputs their first name, last name and class then clicks on the start quiz button.
Then the user answers a series of questions and answer and while this is going on the users name and class should be displayed on the top.
At the end of the quiz, the user should get their full score/ the number of questions answered.

And there should be a second page that has a record of every user that did the quiz in tnat laptop in a tabular format, the first name, the last name, the class and the score.
